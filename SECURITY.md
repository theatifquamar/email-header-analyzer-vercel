# Security Policy

Email Header Forensics is a security-analysis tool, so it's held to the
same standard it applies to the mail it inspects: report problems
responsibly, get a real response, and know what to expect.

## Supported versions

Only the `latest` released version (the most recent tag / the tip of
`main`) is supported. This is a small, actively-developed project without
the resources to backport fixes to older releases — please upgrade to the
latest version before reporting an issue.

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Please do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**
Public issues are fine for bugs, feature requests, and general questions —
but a security report filed publicly gives potential attackers a head
start before a fix ships.

Instead, report privately using one of:

1. **GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting** (preferred): go to the
   **Security** tab of this repository → **Report a vulnerability**. This
   opens a private advisory visible only to the maintainer until resolved.
2. **Direct contact**: reach the maintainer via
   [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/theatifquamar/) if the GitHub
   option isn't available to you.

Please include:
- A description of the issue and its potential impact.
- Steps to reproduce (a minimal example is ideal).
- The version/commit affected.
- Whether the issue is in the application logic (client-side JS), the
  container/deployment configuration, or a third-party dependency.

## What counts as in-scope

Given this project's architecture (a static client-side app with no
backend and no persisted data), the most relevant vulnerability classes are:

- **XSS or script injection** via crafted email headers being rendered
  unsafely anywhere in the UI.
- **CSP bypass** — any way for the page to make a network request outside
  the documented `connect-src` allow-list (which would undermine the
  core "nothing is sent anywhere without an explicit, named exception"
  privacy claim).
- **Supply-chain issues** in a dependency (currently: React, React-DOM,
  Vite, and their transitive dependencies) with a known exploitable CVE.
- **Container hardening regressions** — e.g., the Docker image losing its
  non-root user, read-only filesystem compatibility, or dropped
  capabilities.
- **Incorrect security-relevant analysis logic** — e.g., a scoring bug
  that would cause a clearly malicious sample to be marked "Legitimate."
  This is a correctness bug with security consequences, so it's treated
  as an in-scope report even though it isn't a traditional vulnerability.

Because this tool never sends analysis data to any server, classic
server-side vulnerability classes (SQLi, server-side RCE, auth bypass,
data-breach-via-backend) don't apply — there is no backend and no stored
user data to compromise.

## What to expect

- **Acknowledgment**: within a few days of a private report.
- **Assessment and fix timeline**: communicated once the report is
  triaged; severity drives priority, not a fixed SLA, given this is a
  community project without a dedicated security team.
- **Credit**: reporters are credited in the fix's release notes/changelog
  unless they prefer to remain anonymous — just say so in the report.
- **Disclosure**: coordinated disclosure once a fix is released. If a
  report goes unanswered for an extended period, reasonable public
  disclosure after good-faith attempts to reach the maintainer is
  understood, consistent with standard responsible-disclosure norms.

## About this deployment

This is the Vercel-hosted static deployment. There is no container image
here to sign/verify — see the
[Docker edition](https://github.com/theatifquamar/email-header-analyzer)
if you want a self-hosted deployment with signed, attested container
images (Sigstore/cosign signing + SBOM + build provenance).
